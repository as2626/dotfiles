# Abhay's dotfiles
These are currently a WIP and therefore unstable/constantly changing. I do not recommend using them in their entirety for now. More than fine to just browse though! 

You need to install the stuff under `dotfiles-install` directory first. Clone the repo and move the files to your `$HOME` directory. Careful, since this will overwrite your existing files. It is best to make a back-up of your files beforehand.

This is a cute little picture
